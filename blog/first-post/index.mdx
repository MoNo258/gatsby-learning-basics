#### How this site was created

This site was made with Gatsby tutorial available under this [link](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/).<br />
The difference though is that I created a new Gatsby site using the minimal TypeScript starter.

#### Interesting thing about this Gatsby tutorial

I had issues with deploying this app, there was an error about wrong filename (directory `.cache/compiled` was for some reason included in the path).<br />
The workaround for that was to use `replace`. Yet, although application worked on
_dev_ and was build properly (`gatsby build`), it was still not working while publishing
on **Gatsby Cloud**.<br />
The final solution was to use `path` option like this: `path.join(".cache", "compiled")`.
It turned out that problem is connected to operating system and what is used to point
to directory: _slash_ or _backslash_.<br /><br />
The fun part is that I found **solution** to that in Gatsby documentation
(_finally... I was looking for this... :)_).<br />
This means that workaround is not needed but I will leave this description
either way.<br />
Solution - what to use while dirname part is not working in Gatby TS project
config: [Gatsby docs for
TS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/custom-configuration/typescript/#dirname).
